Fr-Sky Terminal (pron. "Free Sky Terminal") is a native OS X utility loosely based on the Windows program "fdd lite" provided with the Fr-Sky 2.4GHz 2-way Communication (RC telemetry transmitter/receiver) kit. See http://www.frsky-rc.com/Products.asp?BigClassID=17

The initial purpose of the software is simply to give Mac users a native utility to diagnose, program and experiment with Fr-Sky telemetry equipment.

This program stands on its own, but also happens to have been written in conjunction with work being done over at [gruvin9x project](http://code.google.com/p/gruvin9x/).

See the [About](About.md) wiki page for usage and downloading information.
